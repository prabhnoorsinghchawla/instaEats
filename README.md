# instaEats
InstaEats is a web scrapper for Instagram where the user can search for different food based on the location. Whenever I go to a new location I tend to use Instagram to look for food around me because it gives me the actual pictures of the food from the customers rather than the picture on Google.
The application's front-end is created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the API is created using Node.js and Express. The scrapping library I used is Puppeteer, it is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies needed for running the project. Make sure to direct to the server directory first.

```bash
npm install
```
Run the node server using the following command and voila, the project should be up and running. Navigate to the webpage and open them in a browser to try the application yourself.
```bash
node index.js
```
## Usage
Search any food item or a location in the search bar and wait for the scrapper to do its magic
