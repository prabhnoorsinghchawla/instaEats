# instaEats
InstaEats is a web scrapper for Instagram where the user can search for different food based on the location. Whenever I go to a new location I tend to use Instagram to look for food around me because it gives me the actual pictures of the food from the customers rather than the picture on Google.
The application's front-end is created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the API is created using Node.js and Express. The scrapping library I used is Puppeteer, it is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium.
